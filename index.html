            <p>
                Dr. Perera is a physician and artist exploring the healing power of creativity, particularly for those with chronic conditions. A Member of the Royal College of Physicians (UK), she combines her medical background with personal experience as a patient to advocate for integrating creative expression into holistic care. Her digital art reflects this journey, raising awareness of art's therapeutic benefits.

                    â€œOn repeated use, my hands became numb and painful, with the pain radiating to my shoulders. 
                    I found the use of digital medium my adaptation as it enabled me to use light touch with 
                    minimal effort and alternate hands. Less pain and fatigue became apparent in my hands and 
                    arms compared to using a paintbrush on canvas or charcoal or paper 
                    <span class="read-more-toggle">...</span>

                    For me, artistic expression was a means of self-exploration to convey how I was feeling. 
                    I found expression through Art not only represents symbolic aspects of coping but visually 
                    demonstrates the many facets of emotions and degrees of pain I felt at various points in time. 
                    This really helped me to keep the fun side alive and regain a degree of control. 
                    This newfound freedom to explore myself through the world of colours and inner creative space, 
                    gave rise to my present work.
                    <br><br>
                    Art is a tool for positive reinforcement and reflective thinking for me. 
                    I managed to achieve a semblance of normality by starting to set more realistic 
                    goals and standards for me around my limitations.
